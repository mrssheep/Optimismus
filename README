You have to install bumblebee to use Optimismus.

OPTIMISMUS

.. is a GUI for bumblebee (see above).
.. is far from usable.
.. still needs a logo.

USE:
- Install bumblebee.
- Edit the config in optimismus.conf.
- Run "python optimismus.py" to start it.

It was designed on Ubuntu 11.04 _x64 but should run on any Ubuntu >10.04 (not tested).
